That's great! Here are some steps to get you started with Machine Learning:

Python Programming: Python is the most popular language for machine learning. You should get comfortable with Python basics, data structures, and control flow. You can practice Python on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.

Mathematics: Understanding of concepts in Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics is essential in Machine Learning.

Python Libraries: Get familiar with Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. These are useful for data manipulation and analysis.

Machine Learning Theory: Understand the basics of machine learning, such as what is supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning. Learn about different algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.

Scikit-Learn: This is a very important library for machine learning in Python. You should understand how to create models, train them and use them for predictions.

Projects: Implement what you've learned in projects. This is the most effective way to learn.

Deep Learning: Once you are comfortable with machine learning, you can start learning about deep learning. You can start with a library like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Keep Practicing and Exploring: Machine learning is a vast field. Keep exploring new things and keep practicing.
