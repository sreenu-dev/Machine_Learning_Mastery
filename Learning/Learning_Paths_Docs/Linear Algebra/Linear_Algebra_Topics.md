Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors: Scalars are single numbers, vectors are 1-dimensional arrays of numbers, matrices are 2-dimensional (but can be generalized to higher dimensions with tensors).

Vector Operations: Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product.

Matrix Operations: Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transpose, and determinant.

Matrix Types: Identity matrix, diagonal matrix, symmetric matrix, etc.

Systems of Linear Equations: How to solve them using matrices.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: These are important concepts used in many machine learning algorithms.

Vector Spaces and Transformations: Understanding the geometric interpretations of vectors and matrices.

Norms and Distances: Different ways to measure the size of a vector or the distance between two vectors.
