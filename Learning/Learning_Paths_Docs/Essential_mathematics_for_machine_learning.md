The essential mathematics for Machine Learning include:

Linear Algebra: You need to understand vectors, matrices, and their operations as they are fundamental to handling data and parameters in Machine Learning.

Calculus: Concepts like differentiation, partial differentiation, and gradient are important for optimizing Machine Learning models, especially in neural networks.

Probability: Probability theory is crucial for understanding how algorithms model and manage uncertainty in predictions and classifications.

Statistics: Descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, regression models, maximum likelihood estimators are all important in understanding and interpreting data and model outputs.

Optimization: Techniques for finding the minimum/maximum of a function are important for training and tuning machine learning models.

Remember, you don't need to be an expert in all of these areas, but a solid understanding of the basics will go a long way in helping you understand and implement Machine Learning algorithms effectively.
